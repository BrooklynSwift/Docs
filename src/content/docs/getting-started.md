# Getting Started

Brooklyn is a static site generator made in pure Swift. You write fast, type safe Swift code, and I take care of the html, css & JS for you. It's based on result builders, which lets you make a website using syntax similar to SwiftUI.

## Instalation

### Clone the project

```
git clone https://github.com/Brooklyn/Brooklyn/
```
